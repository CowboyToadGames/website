⏺ Based on my analysis of your website codebase, here are my key refinements and improvements to enhance your Cowboy Toad Games website:

  Performance Optimizations

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze current website structure and code quality
     ☒ Review performance and optimization opportunities
     ☐ Identify accessibility and UX improvements
     ☐ Suggest code simplifications and modernizations

⏺ Critical Issues Found:

  1. Duplicate content in content.json:7 - The announcement text repeats 4 times, bloating file size
  2. Missing YouTube URL in index.html:33 - Links to placeholder https://youtube.com/#
  3. Large font file - Jost font loads all weights when only 400/600/900 are used

  Performance Wins:

  - Optimize fonts: &text=CowboyToadGames parameter to load only needed characters
  - Compress images: Convert PNG logos to SVG or optimized WebP
  - Lazy load images: Add loading="lazy" to news images and modal images
  - Preload critical resources: Add <link rel="preload"> for logo and main CSS

  Code Quality Improvements

  JavaScript Simplifications (main.js):

  - Remove unnecessary classes: ContentManager and SearchManager could be simple objects
  - Combine utility functions: Merge similar DOM query functions
  - Simplify modal logic: Remove complex focus management for simpler UX
  - Use modern syntax: Replace function declarations with arrow functions consistently

  CSS Optimizations (styles.css):

  - Reduce custom properties: Many CSS variables are used only once
  - Combine similar classes: .btn-* variants can share more base styles
  - Remove unused styles: Several utility classes appear unused
